# Sample Extensions

This is a collection of WebExtensions that can be used to test stuff in Thunderbird.

To use one of the extensions, clone or download this repository and either:

* Zip the directory of your choice (`manifest.json` should be at the top level of the zip file) and install it like any other Add-On in Thunderbird.
* Choose "Debug Add-Ons" from the Add-Ons Manager menu, click "Load Temporary Add-On" and select `manifest.json` from your source (or any other file part of your Add-On). Temporary loaded Add-Ons do not need to be zipped.
